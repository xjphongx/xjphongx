# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Jimmy Phong

I'm a full stack software engineer who enjoys solving problems and developing web applications. I am currently in the process of honing my technical skill. When I am not coding or debugging, you can find me playing basketball :basketball_man: or walking my cat :smiley_cat:.
